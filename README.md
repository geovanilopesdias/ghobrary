# Gheobrary: small library for small schools | 

**Abstract**: A PHP/MySQL study to abstract small library management.

##Background
As a database connection exercise, I build this little system to manage a small school library. I aim that it'd attend simple functionalities as controlling borrowing, devolution and reservations for registered users by a librarian account.
